# movie_client

This repo is the client-side of [movie_API](https://github.com/Eloi-Perez/movie_api)

It's a React project, using Hooks, Redux for the state management and React-Router for the navigation.

SCSS and React-Bootstrap for the styling.

And I'm using Parcel-Bundler for the building in Netlify, where this project is hosted.
